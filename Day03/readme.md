# Day 03 ‚Äì DSA & C++ Practice

This day covers fundamental sorting algorithms, decision-making constructs, and solving problems with C++.  
Each program demonstrates an important concept with implementation and practice.

## üìÇ Programs

### 1. Three Largest Element
**File:** `1_ThreeLargestElement.cpp`  
- Finds the three largest elements in an array without sorting the entire array.  
- Good practice for array traversal and conditional checks.

### 2. Bubble Sort
**File:** `2_BubbleSort.cpp`  
- Implements the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.  
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
- Time Complexity: **O(n¬≤)**

### 3. Selection Sort
**File:** `3_selectionSort.cpp`  
- Implements the **Selection Sort** algorithm.  
- Selects the smallest (or largest) element and places it at the correct position.  
- Time Complexity: **O(n¬≤)**

### 4. Insertion Sort
**File:** `4_InsertionSort.cpp`  
- Implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm.  
- Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into the correct position.  
- Time Complexity: **O(n¬≤)** (Best Case: **O(n)** when already sorted)

### 5. Switch Statement
**File:** `5_SwitchStatement.cpp`  
- Demonstrates the use of the **switch-case** construct.  
- Useful for menu-driven programs and multiple conditional branching.

### 6. Ternary Operator
**File:** `6_TernaryOperator.cpp`  
- Demonstrates the **ternary operator (`?:`)** in C++.  
- Provides a shorthand way of writing conditional statements.

## üìù Summary
- Practiced **three major sorting algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.  
- Worked on **finding largest elements** in an array.  
- Strengthened understanding of **decision-making constructs** like `switch` and the **ternary operator`.

‚úÖ This day builds a strong foundation in **sorting techniques** and **control structures**, which are essential for problem-solving in C++.
