# 🚀 40 Days DSA & C++ Series

This repository documents my **40 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** journey using **C++**.  
Each day contains multiple problems, their solutions, and concepts implemented in code.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **Day01/** → Basics & simple problems  
- **Day02/** → Arrays & practice problems  
- **Day03/** → Sorting algorithms + control statements  
- **Day04/** → Functions & conditionals  
- *(… more days will be added as I progress …)*  

Each folder has:
- `.cpp` files → source codes  
- `.exe` files → compiled outputs (for testing)  
- `readme.md` → explanations of the day’s programs

## 📅 Daily Progress

### 🔹 Day 01
- Solved beginner-level problems (patterns, loops, and basic arrays).  
- Focused on **input/output** and **logic building**.

### 🔹 Day 02
- Practiced **arrays and loops**.  
- Solved problems like **finding max/min, sums, searching elements**.  
- Did small exercises with **pattern printing**.  

### 🔹 Day 03
- Implemented **sorting algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Solved array problem: **Find three largest elements**.  
- Practiced **switch statement** & **ternary operator**.  

### 🔹 Day 04
- Learned **functions in C++**.  
- Programs: 
  - Greeting Message  
  - Check Even/Odd  
  - Function to Swap Numbers  
  - Prime Number Check  
- Strengthened **conditionals** and function usage.
