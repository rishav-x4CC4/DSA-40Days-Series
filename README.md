# 🚀 40 Days DSA & C++ Series

This repository documents my **40 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** journey using **C++**.  
Each day contains multiple problems, their solutions, and concepts implemented in code.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **Day01/** → Basics & simple problems  
- **Day02/** → Arrays & practice problems  
- **Day03/** → Sorting algorithms + control statements  
- **Day04/** → Functions & conditionals  
- **Day05/** → Searching algorithms & problem solving  
- **Day06/** → Advanced array problems  
- **Day07/** → Prime sieve, array manipulation, rainwater trapping  
- *(… more days will be added as I progress …)*  

Each folder has:
- `.cpp` files → source codes  
- `.exe` files → compiled outputs (for testing)  
- `readme.md` → explanations of the day’s programs
