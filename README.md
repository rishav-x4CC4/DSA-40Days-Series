# 🚀 40 Days DSA & C++ Series

This repository documents my **40 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** journey using **C++**.  
Each day contains multiple problems, their solutions, and small concepts implemented in code.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **Day01/** → Basics & first problems  
- **Day02/** → Arrays & simple programs  
- **Day03/** → Sorting algorithms + control statements  
- *(… more days will be added as I progress …)*  

Each folder has:
- `.cpp` files → source codes  
- `.exe` files → compiled outputs (for testing)  
- `readme.md` → explanations of the day’s programs

## 📅 Daily Progress

### 🔹 Day 01
- Solved beginner-level problems (pattern printing, simple arrays, loops).
- Practiced basic input/output and fundamental logic building.

### 🔹 Day 02
- Focused more on **arrays** and **loops**.
- Worked on small problem-solving exercises (finding min/max, sums, searching, etc.).

### 🔹 Day 03
- Implemented **sorting algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Array-based problem: **Find three largest elements**  
- Practiced **switch statement** & **ternary operator**

*(More details inside each `DayXX/readme.md`)*
