# Day 08 ‚Äì Pointers in C++

This day introduces **pointers in C++**, one of the most important low-level concepts for memory management and data structures.

## üìÇ Topics & Programs

### 1. Introduction to Pointers
**File:** `1_IntroductionToPointers.cpp`  
- Explains what pointers are and how they store memory addresses.  

### 2. Dereferencing a Pointer
**File:** `2_DereferencingPointers.cpp`  
- Demonstrates accessing the value stored at the memory address.  

### 3. Pointer Arithmetic
**File:** `3_PointerArithmetic.cpp`  
- Shows incrementing, decrementing, and pointer differences.  

### 4. Void or Generic Pointers
**File:** `4_VoidPointer.cpp`  
- Demonstrates **void pointers** and their usage.  

### 5. Null Pointers
**File:** `5_NullPointer.cpp`  
- Usage of `NULL` / `nullptr` to indicate no valid address.  

### 6. Pointer to Pointer
**File:** `6_PointerToPointer.cpp`  
- Demonstrates double pointers (`int **ptr`).  

### 7. Pointers and Arrays
**File:** `7_PointersAndArrays.cpp`  
- Relationship between pointers and arrays.  
- Accessing arrays using pointer arithmetic.

## üìù Summary
- Understood the **basics of pointers**.  
- Learned dereferencing and pointer arithmetic.  
- Explored **special cases**: void, null, and double pointers.  
- Practiced the relationship between **pointers and arrays**.
