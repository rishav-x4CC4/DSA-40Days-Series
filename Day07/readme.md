# Day 07 ‚Äì Arrays & Advanced Problems

This day focuses on prime numbers, array manipulation, and classic interview-style problems.

## üìÇ Programs

### 1. Prime Sieve (Sieve of Eratosthenes)
**File:** `1_PrimeSieve.cpp`  
- Generates all primes up to N in **O(n log log n)**.  
- Useful for factorization and number theory problems.  

### 2. Product of Array Except Self
**File:** `2_ProductOfArrayExceptSelf.cpp`  
- Calculates product of all elements except the current index without using division.  
- Uses prefix and suffix products.  

### 3. Rain Water Trapping
**File:** `3_RainWaterTrapping.cpp`  
- Classic problem of finding trapped rainwater between bars.  
- Solved with two-pointer technique in O(n).  

### 4. Good Sub-Arrays (Homework)
**File:** `4_GoodSubArrays.cpp`  
- Counts subarrays that satisfy specific conditions (problem-specific).  

### 5. Merge Sorted Arrays in O(1) Space
**File:** `5_MergeSortedArraysInPlace.cpp`  
- Optimized merge of two sorted arrays without using extra space.

## üìù Summary
- Implemented **prime sieve** for efficient prime generation.  
- Solved **product of array except self** using prefix-suffix arrays.  
- Practiced the **Rain Water Trapping** problem using two pointers.  
- Learned **in-place merging** of sorted arrays.  
- Homework: **Good Sub-Arrays problem**.
