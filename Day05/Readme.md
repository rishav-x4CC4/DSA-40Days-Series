# Day 05 ‚Äì Searching & Problem Solving

This day covers **searching algorithms** and solving problems with arrays and sequences.

## üìÇ Programs

### 1. Binary Search
**File:** `1_BinarySearch.cpp`  
- Implements the **Binary Search** algorithm.  
- Efficient searching in a sorted array.  
- Time Complexity: **O(log n)**  

### 2. First Occurrence
**File:** `2_FirstOccurrence.cpp`  
- Finds the **first occurrence** of a target element in a sorted array using Binary Search variation.  

### 3. Last Occurrence
**File:** `3_LastOccurrence.cpp`  
- Finds the **last occurrence** of a target element in a sorted array.  
- Useful in range-based queries (e.g., frequency count).  

### 4. Unique Number
**File:** `4_UniqueNumber.cpp`  
- Finds the **unique number** in an array where all other elements are repeated.  
- Good practice with bitwise operators (XOR).  

### 5. Generate Sequence
**File:** `5_GenerateSequence.cpp`  
- Generates a sequence of numbers based on given conditions (custom logic).  
- Strengthens **looping and conditionals**.

## üìù Summary
- Learned **Binary Search** and its variations (first/last occurrence).  
- Practiced **bitwise operator logic** to find unique numbers.  
- Worked on **sequence generation** using loops.  
- Improved problem-solving ability with searching + arrays.
